usecase SIMULATION as "Simulation
====
Update the simuation (update the cars)
--
provide the current status of the
simulation for rendering"



usecase GENETIC_ALGORITHM as "Genetic algorithm
====
Manage the neural networks and genomes
--
Retrieve and cross breed the best genomes
--
Hanlde the generations"



usecase NEURAL_NETWORK as "Neural Network
====
Is a black box: input -> output
--
the connection weights
can be get/set"



usecase GENOME as "Genome
====
Store a copy of the weights
of the Neural Network
--
Store the score (fitness)
of the car"



usecase CAR as "Car
====
Rely on 15 physical
raycast to "see" the circuit
--
Can move forward/backward
Can steer left/right
--
Collect checkpoints
as reward"



usecase CIRCUIT as "Circuit
====
Build the circuit ground and
walls by interpolating knots
from a loaded text file"
